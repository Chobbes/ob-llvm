;;; Requirements:
;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

;; optionally define a file extension for this language
(add-to-list 'org-babel-tangle-lang-exts '("llvm" . "ll"))

;; optionally declare default header arguments for this language
(defvar org-babel-default-header-args:llvm '())

;; This is the main function which is called to evaluate a code
;; block.
;;
;; This function will evaluate the body of the source code and
;; return the results as emacs-lisp depending on the value of the
;; :results header argument
;; - output means that the output to STDOUT will be captured and
;;   returned
;; - value means that the value of the last statement in the
;;   source code block will be returned
;;
;; The most common first step in this function is the expansion of the
;; PARAMS argument using `org-babel-process-params'.
;;
;; Please feel free to not implement options which aren't appropriate
;; for your language (e.g. not all languages support interactive
;; "session" evaluation).  Also you are free to define any new header
;; arguments which you feel may be useful -- all header arguments
;; specified by the user will be available in the PARAMS variable.
(defun org-babel-execute:llvm (body params)
  "Execute a block of Llvm code with org-babel.
This function is called by `org-babel-execute-src-block'"
  (message "executing Llvm source code block")
  (let* ((processed-params (org-babel-process-params params))
         (pass-arg (cdr (assq :pass processed-params)))
         (pass (if pass-arg pass-arg "instsimplify"))
         (full-body (org-babel-expand-body:generic

    ;; actually execute the source-code block either in a session or
    ;; possibly by dropping it to a temporary file and evaluating the
    ;; file.
    ;; 
    ;; for session based evaluation the functions defined in
    ;; `org-babel-comint' will probably be helpful.
    ;;
    ;; for external evaluation the functions defined in
    ;; `org-babel-eval' will probably be helpful.
    ;;
    ;; when forming a shell command, or a fragment of code in some
    ;; other language, please preprocess any file names involved with
    ;; the function `org-babel-process-file-name'. (See the way that
    ;; function is used in the language files)
